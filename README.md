# Softdrink Vending Machine Service Time Analysis

This project investigates the service time required for refilling and maintaining softdrink vending machines. The dataset includes 25 observations with the following variables:

* **Y**: Service time in minutes (response variable)
* **x1**: Number of products to be refilled
* **x2**: Walking distance in feet from the delivery van

The analysis is part of a statistics coursework assignment and is implemented in R.

## 📁 Files

* `softdrink.R`: R script containing the full analysis (linear regression, diagnostics, residual analysis)
* `plots/`: Folder containing the plots generated by the analysis
* *(Optional)* `softdrink.txt`: You must provide your own dataset file as described

---

## 📌 Instructions

To run the code:

1. Make sure you have R installed.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Place your own `softdrink.txt` file (with headers `Y x1 x2`) in the root directory of the project.
4. Run the `softdrink.R` script in RStudio or your preferred environment.

```r
# If the file is not found, it will prompt you to select it manually:
softdrink_path <- "softdrink.txt"
```

## 📊 Summary of Analysis

The following statistical procedures are included:

### i) Linear Regression

* Fit: `Y ~ x1 + x2`
* Plots:

  * `x1` vs Observation Index
  * `x2` vs Observation Index
  * Residuals vs Index
  * Residuals vs Fitted values

### ii) Hat Matrix Analysis

* Computed:
  $P_X = X(X^TX)^{-1}X^T$
* Identify high leverage points based on:
  $h_{ii} > \frac{2p}{n}$

### iii) Residual Diagnostics

* Scaled residuals:
  ẽᵢ = êᵢ / σ̂
* Internally studentized residuals:
  rᵢ = êᵢ / (σ̂ √(1 − hᵢᵢ))


### iv) Externally Studentized Residuals

* Calculated as:
  tᵢ = êᵢ / √(σ̂²₍ᵢ₎(1 − hᵢᵢ))

### v) PRESS Residuals and Outlier Detection

* $\hat{\epsilon}_{\text{PRESS},i} = Y_i - \tilde{Y}_i$
* Test statistic:
  $\tilde{t}_i$
* 99% confidence level outlier detection using critical value from t-distribution.
